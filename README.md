flowmachine
===========

An easy vagrant setup for typo3.flow using arch linux

If you have vagrant and virtualbox installed just call vagrant up, enjoy the installation and,
voila you have a working flowinstance in /srv/http/flow on your virtual machine. You can reach
it via 0.0.0.0:8080 on your local machine.

Keep in mind that nothing you do in /srv/http will resist the destruction of your virtual 
machine so you should host your flowprojects on github or whereelse by yourself.

Have fun
